<h2> Regions and availability zones </h2>

Using cloud computing system we can deploy applications in multiple regions and data-replication in another region; and can also access it easily.
As multiple times, we have mentioned regions, lets get to know more about it.

<b> Region: </b> Region is the location of your services.  A region is a set of datacenters connected through a regional low-latency network.

Microsoft azure has the most number of regions currently, so it gives customers the flexibility to deploy application wherever needed.

Two kinds of regions we need to keep in mind:

1) Special government regions (US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, etc.)
 
2) Special partnered regions (China East, China North)

<b> Region Pair: </b> Each region pairing with another region makes region pair. Region pairs are static and we cannot choose it. 

<b> Availability Zone:</b> Then comes the availability zone which is a regional feature. It is designed to protect from data center failures. Availability Zones are grouping of physically separate facilities, so if a zone goes down others continue working. But not all regions are supported in availability zone, a supported region has three or more zones.
